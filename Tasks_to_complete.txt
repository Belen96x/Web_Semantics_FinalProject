Tasks to complete: 

1. Base conceptualisation and modelisation for your graph (S1, S2, S3)
2. Ontology in OWL for the graph (S4)
3. Queries that could be used once the graph is built (S5)
4. The graph in RDF converted from existing data S6

----- AS OF TODAY WE CAN ONLY COMPLETE THESE FIRST FOUR ------------

5. Some code demonstrating the use of your graph S7
6. Validation test done and constraints on the graph S8


---

FOR SHACL:

-We need to create the graph with all the constraints unified. Once we have it, we import it into the repository of GraphDB and 
put in the link part (Named Graph) == the link that appears in the configuration of SHACL constraints.

-Review the ontology in protege with Hermit Reasoner to try and find the inconsistencias (check inferences) -- DONE

-CORRECT THE SECOND SHACL ONE (Check prefixes and syntax that is expecting + Review the query) --DONE

-CREATE A NEW POPULATED GRAPH!!! -- DONE

- RE- DO the queries!!! And recheck Thames

-Clean the code 

-Add the PREFIX for GREL (Is the prefix base) -- DONE

just rework the queries and finish the shacl

7. Ideas about how your application could benefits from learning techniques and other ways of exploring graphs S9, S10

[THEORETICAL]

SHACLS constraints:

1. Date documented needs to be posterior of date of sighting
3. latitude and longitude needs to be float and needs to be one value of each exactly
